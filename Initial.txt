1) Install Python
2) Install robotframework: pip install robotframework
3) Install selenium for robot framework: pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
4) To work with API install: pip install robotframework-requests
5) Download webdrivers for browsers
6) Set python path correctly in system varialbles
-> Create new System Variable named 'PYTHONPATH', example for values: C:\Users\dell\python38;C:\Users\dell\python38\DLLs;C:\Users\dell\python38\Scripts;C:\Users\dell\python38\Lib;C:\Users\dell\python38\libs
-> Now add this system variable in 'path' system variable. Add a new value in 'path' variable as %PYTHONPATH%
7) Add driver location in enviroment variable. Add the directory location in 'path' system variable.
8) To work with robotframework in PyCharm IDE, add the 'IntelliBot' Plugin in PyCharm.
-> Go to https://github.com/lte2000/intellibot
-> Click on intellibot.jar file and download it
-> coy the diectory path to where it is downloaded
-> go to pycharm->Files->Settings->Plugins->Click on Settings Icon ->Select 'Install Plugins from disk' option-> Specify the download directory and select the intellibot.jar file->Restart IDE


-----------------------------
1) Created a New Project amazonRobot
2) Created 3 directories in it : Tests, Resources, Results
3) Inside Tests Created a script by name Amazon.robot
4) Run this script from the Terminal inside PyCharm[View-> Tool Windows -> Terminal]
5) To run give command robot <filenmane.robot>. So in our case command will be robot tests/Amazon.robot
6) By default the results of executing a file will be saved in the 'amazonRobot' directory directly, but we want the results to be saved in "Results" directory.
    So to save the result in some specific place the command will look like: robot -d some/path <filename.robot>
    So in our case the command will be: robot -d results Amazom.robot

----------------------------
To run tests parallely install pabot: pip install robotframework-pabot
usage: pabot [path to tests]
eg: pabot --processes 2 -d results *.robot
